# Orchestration Security



Orchestration is the use of automated tools to manage the operations required to run containers.

Container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, and Docker Swarm, automatically handle tasks such as deciding which Kubernetes nodes in a cluster will host a given container and restarting containers if they crash or become unresponsive.

## Secure Configuration of Orchestrators:&#x20;

Ensure that container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes are configured with security settings, such as RBAC, Network Policies, and Pod Security Policies.

## Certificate Management:&#x20;

Use and manage certificates to ensure secure communication between orchestration system components.
