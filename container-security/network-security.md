# Network Security

## Segment Network Traffic:&#x20;

Use Docker networking to isolate containers on different networks, minimizing the risk of a container being attacked.

## Firewall Rules:&#x20;

Set up firewall rules or network policies to allow only necessary connections between containers and external services.

## Encryption:&#x20;

Use TLS/SSL encryption for communications between containers, especially with external services.
