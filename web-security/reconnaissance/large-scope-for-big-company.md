## Crunchbase

Crunchbase provides a lot of information for the target you want to search for.

## Crt.sh

A pretty useful tool that allows you to find domains and assets of an organization, but you need to know some ways to find them to see new assets.

## ASN

ASN (Autonomous System Number) is a number commonly used in dynamic routing procedures on the Internet.

Usually, large companies will have 1 or a few of their own ASNs, finding out this ASN can be very useful.

## Google Dork (try other bing,duckduckgo,vv)

Searching using search engines like google, yahoo, duckduckgo, etc. is an easy way to search for an organization's assets, here will be an example of google for easy visualization.

```
intext:"Â© Conpany"
site:*.domain.*
site:*.target.* or site:*target.*
intext:"Company name"
```

For a large company, the search will not be within 1 domain range, there may be many different dtd, find more ways
