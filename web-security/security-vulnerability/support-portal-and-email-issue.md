# Support Portal And Email Issue



```
- Create account @target.com , check can login without check token
Incase (target create email support when sent email to support@target.com or 
etc@target.com)
- email ticket :anything+id11@target.com

try send email from (anyuser@gmail.com) to anything+id11@target.com, check support 
portal, have email anyuser@gmail.com ?
if have email, try find 3rd application register with @target.com email account

case 2: email support (support_kk@target.com)
In case email support_kk@target.com register github with that email for company account

attacker create ticket with email noreply@github.com

in that ticket store data from noreply@github.com

-> Account takeover : github reset password link send from noreply@github.com to support_kk@target.com
and that reset token link show in ticket.

```
