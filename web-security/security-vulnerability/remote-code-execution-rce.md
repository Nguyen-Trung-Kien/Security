## Upload File To RCE

## Dependency Confusion

Dependency confusion vulnerability refers to an error when the project uses an external library:

* Importing the wrong library name (requests -> request) the attacker creates a library named request
* Importing an internal library that does not exist: when the internal library does not exist the program will check the public repository, somehow the attacker knows to create a library with the same name in the public repository
* Using an old library in the public repository, but it has been deleted here and the attacker creates a library with the same name as the old one but with a higher version, when updating the library, the program automatically updates the version with the higher version.

## RCE Via another vulnerability

### SQL injection to RCE

I see most often from SQL injection error turned into RCE

### LFI to RCE

In some special cases, LFI vulnerability can lead to RCE.
